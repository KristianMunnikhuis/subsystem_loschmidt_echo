# subsystem_loschmidt_echo

We are currently doing research on the subsystem Loschmidt Echo, a quantity closely related to the loschmidt echo in a many bodied quantum system. We are leveraging DMRG, Exact Diagonalization, and analytical methods to study this quantity.

This project uses both julia and python.

#Packages
Primarily we use ITensor, ITensorMPS for our julia coding.

We utilize QuSpin in python for exact diagonalization.


/src - function files.

/scripts - where a lot of the work is to be done
